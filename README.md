# Pathfinding and Optimization Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of several algorithms designed for pathfinding and optimization tasks, particularly in the context of public transportation scheduling. The algorithms included are A*, Dijkstra's, and Tabu Search, with optimizations and specific adaptations for dealing with complex transfers.

## Algorithms

- **A* Algorithm**: Standard implementation for pathfinding in graphs.
- **A* Optimisation**: Improved version of the A* algorithm with optimizations for better performance in specific scenarios.
- **A* Transfers**: A* algorithm adaptation that considers transfer times between different modes of transportation.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Classic algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph.
- **Tabu Search**: Optimization algorithm that uses a local search method for solving mathematical optimization problems.

## Data

Data for testing these algorithms can be obtained from:
